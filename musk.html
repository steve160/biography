        Elon Reeve Musk, born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, is a world-famous entrepreneur and innovator. From a young age, he showed strong interest in computers and technology, creating and selling a video game at just 12 years old.

At 17, Musk moved to Canada to avoid military service and later studied at the University of Pennsylvania, earning degrees in physics and economics. He briefly started a Ph.D. at Stanford but dropped out to pursue business during the internet boom.

His first success came with Zip2, sold in 1999 for $300 million. He then co-founded X.com, which became PayPal, later sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. With this fortune, Musk turned to bigger goals.

In 2002, he founded SpaceX to make space travel cheaper and prepare for human life on Mars. Despite early failures, SpaceX became the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station and now leads in reusable rocket technology.

In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, eventually becoming CEO. He helped popularize electric cars with models like the Roadster, Model S, Model 3, and Model Y. Tesla also builds batteries and solar products to speed up the shift to clean energy.

Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk founded or supported ventures like SolarCity, Neuralink (brainâ€“computer tech), The Boring Company (tunnel transport), and acquired Twitter/X in 2022.

Today, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Known for his bold vision and controversial style, he aims to make humanity multi-planetary, advance sustainable energy, and shape the future of technology
